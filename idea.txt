you have a gun
you have a limited amount of times you can shoot the other player
each turn you choose a set amount of actions to do
your two options are "shoot other player"
or "shoot the air" (or maybe yourself? maybe in higher rounds you do actually shoot yourself. shrug.)


ooor. its one person with a gun, another person theyre trying to kill. they have a limited amount of each option.

you can do smth like "shoot air air air shoot shoot", maybe the ui shows some that might have a shot and some that might not? and also possibly how many
shots there are in the gun?

it could be more like balatro. your given five (maybe six? sounds better.) shots each reload. half are blank and the others are not.

--------------------------

OK SO. each turn you get six bullets.
you choose for each bullet which you're going to do. either shoot it at the person or shoot it in the air.
you only can shoot half of them at the person. or maybe i can think of another way of making it so they cant just
shoot all into the player... shurg.
